        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <section>
          <ol>
            <li>I love building and deploying web apps!</li>
            <li>
              While I was earning my M.S. in Finance, I began learning
              programming using Python and JavaScript and got hooked. Above all,
              I derive enormous satisfaction from writing code that is neat,
              clean, well-tested and solves peopleâ€™s problems. I enjoy very much
              working on challenging problems and contributing solutions to
              accomplish a greater mission.
            </li>
            <li>I have also been a U.S. equities trader since 2007.</li>
